# LLM Comparison – ChatGPT vs Claude

This document compares how ChatGPT and Claude (Anthropic) responded to the same prompts using the 2025 Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse dataset.

---

## 🔹 Q1: How many games did Syracuse play during the 2025 season?

### ChatGPT:
> "Syracuse played a total of 19 games during the 2025 season."

### Claude:
> Syracuse played 19 games in the 2025 season, finishing 10-9.

**Evaluation:** ✅ Both are accurate.

## 🔹 Q2: Was Syracuse stronger in the first or second half of games?

### ChatGPT:
> "Syracuse scored 139 goals in the first half (74+65) and 95 in the second half (48+47), indicating stronger first-half performance."

### Claude:
> Syracuse was stronger in the first half. They outscored opponents by 23 goals in first halves (+23 goal differential) but were outscored by 9 goals in second halves (-9 differential). This 44-goal scoring drop from first to second half is a significant concern.

**Evaluation:** 🤝 Both are correct, but ChatGPT gives exact numbers. Claude is more general.

## 🔹 Q3: As a coach, should I focus more on offense or defense next season?

### ChatGPT:
> "Given that Syracuse scored slightly more goals than they conceded (235 vs 221), but had fewer saves than opponents (162 vs 168), focusing on defense may yield more gains."

### Claude:
> You should focus more on offense next season. While Syracuse outscored opponents overall (235-221), their offensive production fell dramatically in second halves. The team's 10-9 losing record despite outscoring opponents suggests they lost several close games due to offensive struggles late in games. Key areas to address include second-half scoring consistency, increasing shot volume (they were outshot 552-538), and developing deeper offensive rotations to maintain production throughout games.

**Evaluation:** ✅ Both are insightful. Claude is more interpretive; ChatGPT is more data-backed.

## 💡 Summary:

| Prompt | Better LLM | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Q1     | Tie        | Both correct; Claude adds win–loss context |
| Q2     | Claude     | More analytical and comparative |
| Q3     | Claude     | More nuanced, strategic reasoning |

Both LLMs were helpful, but Claude offered slightly deeper interpretations and strategic thinking. ChatGPT was more numbers-driven; Claude leaned into storytelling and coaching logic.
